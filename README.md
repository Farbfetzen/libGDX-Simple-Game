# libGDX Simple Game

A libGDX tutorial project.
See <https://libgdx.com/wiki/start/a-simple-game>.

## Run

See the file `.sdkmanrc` for the recommended Gradle and Java versions.
Run `gradle desktop:run` to start the game.
This should work on Linux and Windows.
I did not configure or test it for other systems.

## Assets

To run this game you need the assets specified on [the tutorial page](https://libgdx.com/wiki/start/a-simple-game#the-assets).
I didn't include them in this repository because I can't be bothered to work out the licensing for this simple tutorial project.
