# libGDX Simple Game

A tutorial project for the Java game development framework [libGDX](https://libgdx.com/).
See <https://libgdx.com/wiki/start/a-simple-game>.

## Running the game

Run `gradle desktop:run` to start the game.
This should work on Linux and Windows.
I did not configure or test it for other systems.
See the file `.sdkmanrc` for the recommended Gradle and Java versions.

## Assets

To run this game you need the assets specified on [the tutorial page](https://libgdx.com/wiki/start/a-simple-game#the-assets).
Download, rename and put them into the `/assets` folder as specified.
I didn't include them in this repository because I can't be bothered to work out the licensing for this simple tutorial project.
